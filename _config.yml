# This adds the _pages folder to Jekyll and tells it to process and output those files
collections:
  pages:
    output: true
    permalink: /:path/
# When you add a new Markdown file in the _pages folder, it will be processed and outputted to the built site
# using the same directory structure that exists in _pages. For example the directory structure
#
# _pages
#   ├─── my-new-page.md
#   ├─── my-folder
#   |        my-second-page.md
#
# will create the following structure on your website
#
# http://<your_site_name>.com/my-new-page/index.html
# http://<your_site_name>.com/my-folder/my-second-page/index.html
#
# Note that when used as links /my-new-page/index.html is identical to /my-new-page/, so the following are valid as well:
# 
# http://<your_site_name>.com/my-new-page/
# http://<your_site_name>.com/my-folder/my-second-page/
